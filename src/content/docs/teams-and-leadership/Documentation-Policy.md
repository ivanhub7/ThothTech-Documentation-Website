title: Documentation Policy
---

## Purpose

This documentation policy's goal is to provide standards for the use of Markdown and GitHub when
creating, formatting, and disseminating documentation inside our organisation. This policy strives
to provide all organisation members with uniformity, clarity, and simple access to material.

## GitHub and Markdown Overview

The lightweight markup language known as Markdown is perfect for writing documentation since it
makes formatting plain text simple. A web-based platform called GitHub houses version-controlled
repositories and provides collaborative tools.

Please refer to

## The Method of Documentation Production

## Repository Organisation

Every piece of documentation is kept in specific GitHub repositories. Each repository will be
organised clearly, with sections for user manuals, technical references, and API documentation,
among other forms of content.

## Documentation Content

Documentation needs to be organised, clear, and simple. Provide pertinent examples and explanations
while keeping the audience's needs in mind. Where appropriate, include the following sections:

The objective and content of the document are briefly described in the introduction.

Starting Off: A starter manual for individuals unfamiliar with the subject.

Use: Exhaustive

Troubleshooting: Common problems and their fixes.

References: Links to relevant online sources.

## Management of Documentation

On Git ensure the following as we work in groups

## Branches

When working on the documentation, make a new branch for every feature, enhancement, or bug patch.
By doing so, a clear revision history is guaranteed and disagreements are avoided.

## Requests for Pull

When your documentation updates are prepared, send a pull request from your branch to the main
branch. Before merging, give the appropriate reviewers a chance to comment and approve.

## Control of Version

Documentation updates are monitored throughout time with GitHub's version control system.
Consequently, if necessary, we may quickly go back to earlier versions.

## Locating the needed records

Visit the necessary documentation's GitHub repository to access it.

Open the "README" file, which acts as the primary access point, by navigating to it.

Find a specific type of documentation by browsing the repository directories.
